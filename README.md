As a student of data science and a fan of most things football, I jumped at the chance to test out some of my newly found data science chops on optimizing my fantasy football roster. I could rely on projections and recommendations from fantasy football pros, but whereâ€™s the fun in that? There are so many sources to get projections and rankings for players, so why not use multiple sources to improve my roster?
This repository is intended to demonstrate the method I used to build select quarterbacks, tight ends, wide receivers, and running backs for my fantasy football team. I want to stress that this is by no means the best method or the only method, but it is a method.
